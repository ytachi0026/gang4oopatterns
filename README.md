# Software Patterns
This is a repository where I will write down some code regarding the book of Design Patterns, Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software, whose authors are Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson, John M. Vlissides. 

I will be using Java language programming, I opt for the 8 version but not sure if it would be necessary. Additionally: IDE IntelliJ Idea 2017, gradle, some testing using JUnit 5, etc.
